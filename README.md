# LeNet-5-network-MNIST-Fashion
Implementing a LeNet-5 network to recognize the Fashion-MNIST.
* Modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance.
  * activation function
  * weight initialization
  * kernel size
  * number of filters per layer
  * optimizer
  * learning rate
  * dropout
  * batch normalization
* Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
* Provide a plot of accuracy, the convergence curve for LeNet-5.
* Comments on results
* Using other CNN models (using transfer learning) and compareing the results with the full trained LeNet-5.
